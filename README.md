# React Learning Projects

This repository contains a series of simple React applications I created as part of my initial exploration into React. The projects within focus on various fundamental aspects of React such as state management, component structure, and effect handling. Each application is built using functional components and hooks, showcasing different React concepts in practice.

## Applications Included

### 1. Counter

A simple counter application that allows users to increment, decrement, or reset the count using `useState` to manage the counter state.

**Key Concepts:**
- State management with `useState`.
- Handling events with `onClick`.

### 2. Color Picker

This application features a color picker that updates its background color based on user input.

**Key Concepts:**
- Syncing input element with state using `useState`.
- Dynamically updating styles based on state.

### 3. Digital Clock

Displays the current time, updating every second.

**Key Concepts:**
- Using `useState` to store current time.
- Utilizing `useEffect` for side effects (setting and clearing interval).
- Formatting JavaScript Date objects.

### 4. To-Do List

Manage your tasks with functionalities to add, delete, and reorder tasks.

**Key Concepts:**
- Complex state handling and array manipulations.
- Conditional rendering and list management.

### 5. Stopwatch

A stopwatch that includes start, stop, and reset functionalities, displaying elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

**Key Concepts:**
- Advanced use of `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect` for time-sensitive updates.
- Managing intervals and preserving time across renders with `useRef`.
